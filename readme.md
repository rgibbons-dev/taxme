# taxme

this is a simple program that, given an input of some income
that is a valid number (i'm trusting that you play by the 
rules here!), it will return the total federal tax owed in
the 2024 tax year.

i've supplied a standalone JAR to be run, or you can build 
and run it manually.

i'm learning my way around clojure (with some assistance from
Claude 3 Opus), so this is the first fruit to ripen from this.
